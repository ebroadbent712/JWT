# Just Wear This styling rules

These rules are the product. Follow them on every board. When two rules conflict, the priority is:
**client limits → camera rules → coordination rules → color story.**

## Decision order

1. Check the limits first: hard no's, owned pieces, anything sensitive.
2. Pick the color story from season, setting and light.
3. Choose the anchor.
4. Place the print (or decide on none).
5. Dress everyone else around the anchor and print, balancing light and dark.
6. Add shoes and accessories last, keeping their tones related.
7. Check the whole board (see "Final check" at the end).

## Core coordination rules

1. **One anchor.** One person wears the richest color or the most special piece; everyone else supports it. Mom is the anchor about 90% of the time. Otherwise it is usually a girl in a truly unique dress or outfit. Occasionally Dad can anchor when he is layered well (for example a rich sport coat over a sweater).
2. **Three to five colors.** Every piece belongs to the story's palette. Neutral shoes, belts and small accessories don't count.
3. **Prints in balance.** Prints are welcome, but too many make a photo busy. Default to one print, worn by one or two people in different garments. Pattern mixing is allowed when done right: at most two prints, sharing at least one color, in clearly different scales (one small, one larger). Prints on no more than about a third of the group; fewer for extended families.
4. **Small checks count as texture.** Fine gingham, micro-checks and tight herringbone read as solids and can sit beside a print. Bold plaids and stripes count as a print.
5. **Coordinate, never match.** No two people in the same garment and color. Siblings may share a print in different pieces. Matching too closely is the most common mistake. Some catalog pieces list `never_with`: those pieces are too similar to share a board (for example, Mom's and a girl's dress in the same print and shape), so never use them together.
6. **Balance light and dark.** Spread dark pieces across the group. Don't put all the light colors on the kids and all the dark on the parents. No single color should be the main piece on more than about half the group; too much of one color is the second most common mistake.
7. **Contrast inside each outfit.** Each person's top or layer and their bottom must clearly differ in lightness: light over dark or dark over light. Never put two pieces of nearly the same shade together on one person, because on camera they melt into one block. Common misses: a camel cardigan or oatmeal sweater over stone chinos, a navy sweater over dark jeans, a camel coat over a camel dress. One exception: a navy blazer over dark jeans is a classic and is fine for one person on a board, not more. A shirt underneath doesn't fix it; the layer and the bottom are what the camera sees. The board script flags these with a CHECK line.
8. **Layers and texture.** The best boards almost always have layers and texture. Give at least half the group a layer (cardigan, jacket, vest, sweater over a collar) when the weather allows. Favor knit, wool, suede, corduroy, linen and denim.
9. **Same occasion, same formality.** Pick the formality from the dress level the client chose, then keep everyone within one step of it.

**Formality steps:** relaxed (knits, denim, sneakers) → dressy casual (dresses, chinos, boots, button-downs) → polished (sport coats, tailored dresses, leather shoes) → formal (suits, gowns).

**When someone won't dress up:** a dad or teen who refuses gets the basics: jeans and a simple top in a story color, plus whatever shoes they're comfortable in (use the closest library shoe and note "his own sneakers are perfect"). The rest of the family carries the styling.

## Color stories

| Story | Season | Best settings | Usual anchor |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cabernet and Navy | Late fall, winter | Parks, brick downtown, indoor holiday | Cabernet |
| Spring Garden | Spring | Gardens, blossom trees, green fields | Dusty blue or sage |
| Coastal | Summer | Beach, lake, dunes, golden hour | Dusty navy or terracotta |
| Harvest | Early and mid fall | Golden fields, orchards, pumpkin patches | Rust or chocolate |
| Evergreen | Winter, holiday | Snow, tree farms, studio holiday | Forest |

Palettes live in `library/catalog.json`. Choosing a story:

- Season and setting decide first; then the light. Warm golden hour favors Harvest and Coastal; cool or overcast favors Cabernet and Navy and Evergreen.
- A color the client loves pulls toward the story that contains it. Colors they want to avoid are never used.
- If the photos will hang at home and they sent a room photo, weigh the room's colors over the setting.
- Only use stories marked `"stocked": true` in the catalog. If the right story isn't stocked yet, use the closest stocked one and tell the photographer.

## Rules by person

| Person | Priorities | Go-to pieces | Avoid |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Women | Movement, a defined waist or clean column, comfort sitting on the ground | Midi and maxi dresses with movement, knit dresses, cardigans over dresses, tall or ankle boots | Very short hems, stiff fabric, anything she'll keep adjusting |
| Men | Structure and texture, never stiff | Textured sport coats, knit sweaters, button-downs, chinos, dark denim, leather shoes | Graphic tees, athletic wear, baggy fits, bold patterns |
| Teen girls | Her own style within the story | Sweaters, slip or knit dresses, wide-leg pants, ankle boots, sneakers if that's her | Anything she'd never choose; overly young pieces |
| Teen boys | Comfort, "not trying too hard" | Crewnecks, untucked button-downs, chinos or dark jeans, clean sneakers | Logos, graphics, gym-style joggers |
| Girls (4–12) | Movement and twirl | Smocked or tiered dresses, sweaters with skirts, tights, ankle booties, small bows | Sequins, character prints, scratchy fabric |
| Boys (4–12) | Soft structure, room to move | Button-downs or sweaters, cords or chinos, sneakers or boots | Clip-on ties, stiff collars, character prints |
| Toddlers (1–3) | Comfort above all | Rompers, soft knits, overalls, soft-soled shoes or barefoot | Buttons at the back of the neck, hard shoes, hats |
| Baby girls | Soft texture, easy diaper access, sweet | Soft dresses (with bloomers), smocked or floral dresses, cardigans, a soft stretchy bow headband | Busy prints, tight or pinching headbands, bonnets, stiff collars, a boy's set |
| Baby boys | Soft texture, easy diaper access | Soft knit or waffle sets (sweater and pants), cable knits, booties | Dresses or bubble rompers, frills, stiff collars |
| Grandparents, extended family | Part of the family, not styled like the kids | Solid knits, button-downs, blouses, cardigans in quieter story colors | Being the anchor (unless they want it); keep prints minimal |
| Couples only | Both can carry color; still one anchor | One deeper or patterned piece, one supporting solid | Matching outfits, two prints |

**A color the client rules out is ruled out everywhere,** including the thin lines in a tartan, plaid or check and the flowers in a floral. "No red" also means no burgundy or cherry stripes in a print; check each print's `colors` list before using it.

**Baby boys get a soft set first** (a sweater-and-pants or cardigan set). Use a knit romper only when no set fits the story.

**Baby girl or boy:** the questionnaire or the photographer says which. Baby pieces carry `baby_for` (`girl`, `boy` or `either`); only use matching or `either` pieces. If the client chose "Either", use `either` pieces only. If it isn't clear, ask in the same one-line message as any other missing detail; on a gift board (no questionnaire), use `either` pieces instead of asking. A client who rules out bows gets no headband.

**Teens can wear adult pieces:** catalog pieces with `also_for: ["teen boys"]` or `["teen girls"]` (men's jeans, sneakers, loafers, coats; women's sweaters and boots) belong on a teen's shortlist too. Don't call it a library gap when an adult piece fits.

**Extended families:** a bigger version of one family: same rules, fewer prints. For big groups, each household can lean on two story colors plus the shared neutrals.

## Setting, season and light

| Setting | What works | Avoid |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Golden hour field | Warm neutrals, cream, rust, dusty blue; flowy fabrics | Head-to-toe white, greens matching the grass, yellow |
| Park with trees | Jewel tones, navy, cream, texture | Greens and browns that match the foliage |
| Urban and brick | Navy, cream, camel, cleaner lines | Rust and brick red |
| Beach and coastal | Sand, soft white, chambray, dusty navy, terracotta | Bright white at midday, heavy fabrics, black |
| Snow and winter | Forest, burgundy, navy, camel, chunky knits, coats | White and pale gray, thin layers |
| Studio or home | Clean silhouettes, soft knits | Busy prints, clashing with the home |

- Dress for the real temperature; plan warm layers into the look for evenings below about 55°F.
- **Editing style (from settings):** true to color can use the full palette as long as it's balanced; light and airy should soften the darkest pieces; moody can go deeper.

## Camera rules

**Never on a board:** logos, graphics or words; neon or fluorescent colors (they cast color onto skin); very fine high-contrast stripes or checks (moiré); unlined sheer fabrics; shiny or metallic main pieces; character and novelty prints.

**Use with care:** bright white (prefer ivory or cream; keep bright white to small areas like sneakers); black (one person at most, textured); saturated greens and reds near the face; clingy fabrics.

**The camera loves:** texture that catches light, movement, soft contrast between people, and fits that stay put when people sit and hug.

## Client limits and sensitive cases

- **Hard no's** override everything, including the color story. "Dad won't wear color" moves the color to someone else.
- **"Something special" requests:** when the client asks for someone to stand out ("Dad would love something special", "she wants to look cool"), that person gets a piece marked `"statement": true` that fits the story, not a plain basic. This counts toward the board's one or two statement pieces.
- **Owned pieces:** build around them. A loved owned piece can become the anchor. Mark owned pieces in the plan's `owned` list so the board says "You have this" instead of shop links. If an owned piece has no library image, use the closest library piece and say so in the delivery note.
- **Bodies:** never comment on bodies. Talk about clothes ("easy to move in", "a little drape"), never about hiding or flattering.
- **Pregnancy:** stretch, wrap and empire-waist pieces.
- **Culture, faith and modesty:** follow stated needs without comment.
- **Mobility and sensory needs:** adaptive or seamless pieces, easy closures; comfort beats the plan.
- **Identity:** use the labels and pronouns the family gives; style people by what they want to wear.

## Shopping

- No budget question. Each piece has up to three shop links in price tiers, and the client mixes tiers piece by piece. Links can come from any of these stores (the catalog holds the actual links):
  - **Everyday:** Target, Old Navy, Kohl's, H&M, Walmart, Amazon, Gap Factory, Abercrombie Kids, Lands' End
  - **Mid:** Gap, J.Crew Factory, Madewell, Banana Republic, L.L.Bean, Boden, Hope & Henry, Hanna Andersson, Janie and Jack, Petal & Pup, DressUp, Lulus, Baltic Born, Quince, Abercrombie, Mango, Everlane, DSW
  - **Splurge:** Nordstrom, J.Crew, Anthropologie, Free People, Reformation, Sézane, Doen, Hill House Home, Christy Dawn, Tuckernuck, Todd Snyder, Faherty, Little English, Jacadi, Rachel Riley, Rylee + Cru, Sam Edelman, Clarks, Vince
- Pick the store with the widest size range (plus, petite, tall, toddler through big kid) when two matches are equally close.
- Links are "shop the look", not exact items. A blank tier means no good match exists.
- Never search stores live while building a board. Use the links in the catalog only.
- Boards print smart links (justwearthis.co/s/...) that forward to the current store page, so a sold-out item can be swapped without re-sending the board.

## Variety (so clients don't all look the same)

The library is shared by many photographers, so boards must not keep reaching for the same favorite pieces.

1. **Build a shortlist first.** For each person, list every library piece that fits the rules and the client's answers equally well, not just the first good one.
2. **Rotate within the shortlist.** Sort the shortlist by item ID. Work out the family number once: add up the letters of the family's last name (A=1, B=2 … Z=26; Hartwell = 8+1+18+20+23+5+12+12 = 99), then add the session's day of the month (1 if unknown). For each person, count around their shortlist to position (family number + the person's place on the board, Mom 1, Dad 2, and so on). Using the letters themselves (not just how many there are) keeps families with same-length names from getting identical picks, and the person offset stops everyone moving in lockstep. Same family, same answer every time, so rebuilding a board doesn't shuffle it.
3. **Vary the anchor look.** Each story has three or four anchor options for Mom; apply the rotation to the anchor choice too, unless the client's answers clearly favor one.
4. **Within one conversation,** don't give two different families the same anchor piece back to back; take the next piece on the shortlist instead.
5. **One statement piece per board (aim for at least one), two at most.** Pieces marked `"statement": true` in the catalog (velvet, tulle, a bow blouse, a fair isle sweater, a cord military jacket and similar) are what make a board memorable. Put the statement piece on the anchor or on one child, never on everyone, and rotate statement pieces the same way as everything else.
6. **Vary the shoes and the basics.** Don't give every adult camel or brown suede; use the darker boots, loafers and Mary Janes too. Dad's dark jeans and oatmeal crewneck are easy defaults: only use them when the rotation lands there, and never give one person a whole outfit identical to a recent board in the same conversation.
7. **Client answers come first.** Loved colors, print preferences, hard no's and owned pieces override the rotation. Rotation only breaks ties.

## "Does this work?" checks

When the photographer pastes a photo of a client's own piece and asks whether it works:

1. Identify the piece: color, texture, pattern, formality.
2. Judge it against this board's color story, the anchor and the print rules.
3. Answer in one line: **yes** with one reason, **no** with one reason, or **yes, if** with one small change. If no, suggest the closest library swap and offer to rebuild the board.

## Final check (before delivering)

- Is exactly one person clearly the anchor?
- Does anyone match anyone else too closely?
- Does each person's top or layer clearly contrast with their bottom (no camel on stone, no navy on dark denim)?
- Is any one color the main piece on more than about half the group?
- Prints: at most two, sharing a color, different scales, on no more than a third of people?
- Does at least half the group have a layer (weather allowing)?
- Is everyone within one formality step of the chosen dress level?
- Are all hard no's respected and no avoided colors used?
- Does the board's dress level match the client's answer?
